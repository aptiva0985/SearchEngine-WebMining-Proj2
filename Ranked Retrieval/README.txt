Hi, this is my homework #2 source code package.

The bin folder contains all .class file that generated by eclipse.

The src folder contains all .java source code file

All the should locate in the clueweb09_wikipedia_15p_invLists folder by default. It is necessary for running the program.
This folder¡¯s position can be changed at the beginning part of main.java in src folder. There is comment to point out corresponding statement.

The default input file is the input.txt in this folder. The input file path can be changed at the beginning part of main.java in src folder.

The result of program will output to output.txt in the root folder by default.
This file¡¯s position can also be changed at the beginning part of main.java is src folder. There is comment to point out corresponding statement.

The resultSet folder contains more experiment result for review.

The stoplist.txt store all the stopwords.


Hope my program will run properly and provide satisfied result. If there is any problem with it, please feel free to contact any time 24x7 :).
